Stack Data Structure is used when there is a need for the most recent sub-solution in progressing for whole solution.
Examples: Recursion i.e it breaks problems into subproblems by calling subroutine itself and stored them in stack data structure.
Let say Fact( n ), a recursive function to get factorial of an integer n, its progresses in this fashion. fact( n ), fact( n - 1 ) , ......, fact( 1 ) . In stack, it stores in subroutines in stack fashion and need fact( n - 1) to solve fact( n ).
